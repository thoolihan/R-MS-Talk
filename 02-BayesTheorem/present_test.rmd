# Background
* The odds of being a 10x dev are 1/1000
* The odds of 10x passing hypothetical dev test 19/20
* The odds of non-10x passing hypothetical dev test 1/5

## Probability Table
*this time, we show source*
```{r}
source('dev_test.R')
prob
```

## Results
You can also do inline calculations...

Given a positive exam result, the odds that the candidate is a 10x dev is `r answer` (`r answer * 100`%, or slighly < 1%).

## Plot
```{r, echo = FALSE}
prob <- prob[,c(1,4)]
pf <- data.frame(time = c('any candidate', 'w/passing test'), 
                 positive = prob[1,],
                 negative = prob[2,])

library(ggplot2)
g = qplot(time, positive, 
          data = pf, color = '10x', geom = 'point') + 
  ylim(c(0,1)) + 
  geom_point(aes(time, negative, color = 'non 10x')) 
g
